       Hello friends, Today I am going to tell you about my journey of coding. So let's start.
   </h2>
   <h3> 
       When I was in 8th standard my computer teacher was teaching my class HTML coding and I was the first student who always completed the practical first.
        HTML coding took me to the world of programming. I learnt my HTML and CSS from Webtech Learning Institute from Sec- 34-A Chandigarh, it was a awesome journey.
        Then I got to know about WhitehatJr through facebook, a company which teaches coding online. I was on the top of cloud when I successfully completed my trial class with my teacher Ms.
        Ruchita Kukreja. My journey with WhitehatJr has been fantastic and fabulous. It is just because of them I am able to reach till here. My teacher always made my day a funday.
        I would like to thanks them to understand my potential and to make me a good programmer.
